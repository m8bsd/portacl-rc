## I've created a basic console-based blog application in Java. Here's what it includes:
## Features:

1. Create blog posts with title, content, and author
2. Read - list all posts or view a specific post
3. Update existing posts
4. Delete posts
5. Simple menu-driven interface

## Components:

1. BlogPost - Model class with id, title, content, author, and timestamp
2. BlogService - Handles all CRUD operations
3. SimpleBlog - Main application with console interface

The blog starts with two sample posts. To run it, save the code to a file named SimpleBlog.java, compile it with javac SimpleBlog.java, and run with java SimpleBlog.
